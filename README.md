Orphan enzyme project
=======

Goal is to identify sequences for orhpan enzymes and then use thse to evaluate some, as of yet unspecified, bioinformatic approach.

as described in Shearer et al 2014
Collect all EC numbers from BRENDA or ENZYME
Check for sequences in UniProt, Enzyme, NCBI Entrez Protein, Orenza, BioCyc, TrEMBL
Identify EC numbers which lack sequences in all these databases -> putative orphans
Check BRENDA, MetaCyc and IUBMB for list of terms associated with an EC activity
Check BRENDA and MetaCyc for seqeuence in commentary/clonning or protein section
Collect references
Make permutations of terms (remove numbers, dashes, references to co-fators or chirality)
Search PubMed for more refrenceses using the expanded list of terms
Search patents for those containing expanded list of terms
Try to find sequence identifiers or sequence


Curtosy update to UniProt
Update to Brenda
Submit update to GenBank

How to use
----------

* Create a new directory for your project.
* Download the [latest version] of this repository, and unzip it in the directory you just created.
* Open this document in an editor. Change the first line to reflect the title of your research study, and delete the rest of the content in this file. You can, but are not obligated to keep the Acknowledgements section.
* Modify the .env file to contain the passwords and usernames appropriate for your project.
* Make use of the Python template file "template_engine.py" in the code folder each time a new Python script is needed. That way is has all the boilerplate code in it.
* Go forth and experiment, keeping files in their appropriate places.
* Don't **ever** edit your raw data, especially not manually, and especially not in Excel. Don't overwrite your raw data. Don't save multiple versions of the raw data. Treat the data (and its format) as immutable. The code you write should move the raw data through a pipeline to your final analysis. You shouldn't have to run all of the steps every time you want to make a new figure, but anyone should be able to reproduce the final products with only the code in src and the data in data/raw.
* To the greatest extent possible, download external data programmatically and not through point-and-click in your browser. This creates automatic documentation (your code) of where the external data can be found.

Key concepts and goals
----------------------

See [Noble 2009] for a full description of and argument for the principle template structure. Some concepts and goals that guided this work:
* (Good) There is a folder for the raw data, which do not get altered, or intermixed with data that is the result of manual or programmatic manipulation. I.e., derived data is kept separate from raw data, and raw data are not duplicated.
* (Good) Code is kept separate from data.
* (Better) Manuscript production output is kept separate from everything else.
* (Good) There is a scratch directory for experimentation. Everything in the scratch directory can be deleted at any time without negative impact.
* (Better) There should be a `README` in evey directory, describing the purpose of the directory and its contents.
* (Best) There is a top-level `Makefile` or [Rmarkdown] file that documents the computational study in executable form. Those files may call out to other `Makefile`'s or `.Rmd` files in subdirectories.
* (Best) There is a formal metadata descriptor at the root of the package that describes all the important input and output data files.
* (Meta) The template structure should have no special software or skill prerequisites to install. Specifically, deploying the template structure should not require installing git, or using the command line.

The initial file and directory structure of this project was developed by a group of participants in the Reproducible Science Curriculum Workshop, held at [NESCent] in December 2014. The structure is based on, and heavily follows the one proposed by [Noble 2009], with a few but small modifications. The [original repository] has been modified and the one presented here differs in some ways.
